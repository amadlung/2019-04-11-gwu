[**Data Carpentry**](https://datacarpentry.org/) (part of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)) develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Its target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational experience, and its lessons are domain specific, building on learners' existing knowledge to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems. For more information on what we teach and why, please see our paper "[Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)".

**WHEN:** April 11-12, 2019 (9:00 AM - 5:00 PM)

**WHERE:** Gelman Library, 2130 H St NW, Room 301/302, Washington, DC 20052 . Get directions with [OpenStreetMap](https://osm.org/go/ZZcbJto48?way=66409261) or [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/vZdYWxLsZwQ2).

**TARGET AUDIENCE:** The target audience is students (both undergraduate and graduate), who have little to no prior computational experience. Post-docs and Faculty are welcome to apply too.
> The instructors will prioritize creating a friendly environment that will empower researchers and enable data-driven discovery. Even those with some experience will benefit, as the goal is to teach not only how to do analyses, but how to manage the process to make it as automated and reproducible as possible.

**Learning objectives for this workshop:**
+ Accessing Cloud Computing Resources
+ UNIX command line
+ Environment management using Conda & bioconda
+ Building Reproducible Workflows

# Introduction
While not a pre-requisite, those of you who have taken Bio 211 (Ecology) or Math 160 or 260 (Statistics) will find this lab a lot easier than those of you without statistics knowledge.
Plant Physiology requires you to use statistics, but there is no time to cover the basics of statistics in the same way that other classes do. That said, you will need to learn some statistics in a hurry to analyze your independent project data, but it isn’t absolutely required that you understand the underlying math to use statistics if you are willing to learn some statistics protocols and simply carry them out. I would recommend that you at a later time do take either Math 260 or Bio 211 if you haven’t to give you a more nuanced view of statistics. This lab will teach you two things:

## Objectives:
1.	Learn to use RStudio to execute and edit pre-written scripts. 
2.	Learn the basics of statistical test and when to use them.
